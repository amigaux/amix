 * a4091_dmarec.h -- the D42 DMA-coherence seam as the A4091 calls it (040/060
 * driver line only; included by a4091-wr.c under -DA4091_KVA).
 *
 * D42 as agreed with the port author (letter 04, 2026-09-28): ONE protocol and
 * state machine, in the port's src/dma_cache040.s; the per-controller RECORD
 * lives in each controller's own object.  Names, magic and offsets below are
 * the agreed ones (docs/D42-CALL-SHAPE.md).  The service is not written yet, so
 * until it is linked a4091-wr.c builds local stubs (no cache maintenance at all)
 * unless -DA4091_D42 is given.
 *
 * Every field is a longword so the service can reach it with movel and a fixed
 * displacement; the offsets are the contract.  All service fields are
 * contiguous (0x14..0x4c, one kpeek), all driver fields 0x50..0x5c.
 *   D = the driver writes it (the service only reads it)
 *   S = the service writes it (the driver only reads it, for diagnostics)
 *
 * Cache ops, per 16-byte line of the owned range rounded outward:
 *   prepare  cpushl dc then cinvl dc (040: cinvl is a no-op after the push;
 *            060: correct whatever CACR.DPI is)
 *   complete FROM_DEVICE: cinvl dc.  TO_DEVICE: no op.  NO re-push of edges.
 * Edge lines: a FROM_DEVICE range whose pa or pa+len is not on a 16-byte
 * boundary shares a line with unrelated bytes; a CPU write there mid-transfer
 * is lost either way at complete.  The service does not try to repair it; it
 * counts the range in edge_shared, and the acceptance invariant requires
 * edge_shared == 0.  TO_DEVICE ranges are never counted (no op at complete).

 * dma_prepare  -- before the driver arms the device (the DSP write that starts

 *                 segment is PREPARED, nonzero when it is not (off, still owned,
 *                 bad range); the driver arms either way -- nothing may panic.
 * dma_complete -- after the device has stopped touching the segment (its
 *                 completion, or a forced quiesce), before the sd callback.
 *                 FROM_DEVICE: invalidate the owned lines; TO_DEVICE: no op.
 *                 Consumes the record (state -> EMPTY).
 * pa is PHYSICAL (sdcom.addr is physical by contract on this line); the service
 * works by physical line, so one op covers every virtual alias of the page.
